  <div class="about-aba">
    <h2>What is ABA?</h2>
    <p>Started as an accountability group idea, Artist Back Alley is a growing collective of artists that have an
      undying appreciation for other fellow artists in the art streaming community. We are a small but mighty team that
      wishes to celebrate, support, and promote our fellow creatives through digital art-spaces, accountability groups,
      and event organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these events, Artist Back Alley hosts collaborative art projects that span across genres of art, the
      internet, and inspiration, with the vision of celebrating every artistâ€™s unique style and talent while also
      building
      a passionate and inclusive community.
    </p>

  <div class="about-hypertrain">
    <h2>What is the Hyper Train?</h2>
    <p>
      The Hyper Train is ABA's first collaborative art project centering the wide variety of talent from artists in our
      dearly loved twitch creative community. The project will run on artistbackalley.com for a year acting as an artist
      gallery and directory, until a new theme/art challenge is announced for 2021's holiday season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each participating artist is given the task to create and design their own boxcar with the provided templates to
      work off of. During the creative/design process, Artist Back Alley encourages artists to stream their progress
      while both promoting themselves but also the community art project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hyper Train project is open to any artist within the twitch community that would like to participate. For
      those that stream actively, they can create a featured artist boxcar that adds them into the creative streamer
      directory, for those that wish to participate as community members, but perhaps shy away from the attention, we
      are always accepting transitional boxcar designs to link the train together! We want this digital art installation
      to be as representative of the twitch creative community as it can be for the year it rolls around the internet,
      so please join in on the fun!
    </p>

  <div class="about-artist-alley">
    <h2>What is the Artist Alley?</h2>
    <p>The Artist Alley portion of ABA's annual art project/event takes place during the ultimate chaos of the Holiday
      Shopping Season. We aim to give Artist Alley motivation to update their online stores, create promo codes and
      materials, and take initiative to work hard on their ecommerce/commission services. We provide support leading up
      to the event by setting goals and deadlines, creating promotional assets, raising funds for ad revenue, discussing
      the processes of manufacturing, price setting, and sharing advice with each other in our community discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Artist Alley event, participating artists will be encouraged to join scheduled raid trains on Twitch
      and/or take part in other collaborative activities that showcase and promote their available products/services.
